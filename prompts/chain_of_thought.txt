You are analyzing a social interaction to determine the speaker's emotional state.

## Scenario

**Context:** {context}

**Speaker:** {speaker_role}
**Listener:** {listener_role}

**What the speaker says:** "{utterance}"

## Task

Based on this context and utterance, what emotion is the SPEAKER most likely experiencing?

Think through this step by step:

1. **Literal meaning**: What does the utterance literally say?
2. **Contextual cues**: What does the situation suggest about what is really going on?
3. **Pragmatic interpretation**: Is there a gap between what is said and what is meant?
4. **Speaker's internal state**: What is the speaker likely feeling beneath the surface of their words?
5. **Primary emotion**: Which single emotion best captures the speaker's state?

After your reasoning, choose exactly ONE emotion from this list:
- joy
- trust
- fear
- surprise
- sadness
- disgust
- anger
- anticipation

Important: Focus on the SPEAKER's emotional state, not the listener's reaction.

## Response Format

Then, on a new line, write: "Answer: [emotion]"
