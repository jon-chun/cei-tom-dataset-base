You are analyzing a social interaction to determine the listener's emotional response.

## Scenario

**Context:** {context}

**Speaker:** {speaker_role}
**Listener:** {listener_role}

**What the speaker says:** "{utterance}"

## Task

Based on this context and utterance, what emotion would the LISTENER most likely feel?

Think through this step by step:

1. **Literal meaning**: What does the utterance literally say?
2. **Contextual cues**: What does the situation suggest about the speaker's actual intent?
3. **Pragmatic interpretation**: Is there a gap between what is said and what is meant?
4. **Listener's perspective**: How would the listener interpret this utterance given the context?
5. **Emotional response**: What emotion would this interpretation evoke in the listener?

After your reasoning, choose exactly ONE emotion from this list:
- joy
- trust
- fear
- surprise
- sadness
- disgust
- anger
- anticipation

Important: Focus on the LISTENER's emotional response, not the speaker's intent or emotional state.

## Response Format

First, provide your step-by-step reasoning.
Then, on a new line, write: "Answer: [emotion]"

Where [emotion] is one of the 8 emotions listed above (lowercase, no punctuation).
