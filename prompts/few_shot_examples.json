  "examples": [
    {
      "subtype": "sarcasm-irony",
      "context": "After a coworker's presentation that was clearly underprepared and received poorly by the team, a colleague approaches them in the hallway.",
      "speaker_role": "colleague",
      "listener_role": "presenter",
      "utterance": "Well, that was certainly... memorable.",
      "ground_truth_emotion": "sadness",
      "explanation": "The listener recognizes the sarcastic tone—'memorable' here means the opposite of positive. The listener likely feels hurt or dejected."
    },
    {
      "subtype": "sarcasm-irony",
      "context": "A team member arrives 30 minutes late to an important meeting for the third time this week. The meeting leader pauses and addresses them.",
      "speaker_role": "meeting leader",
      "listener_role": "late team member",
      "utterance": "So glad you could make it.",
      "ground_truth_emotion": "anger",
      "explanation": "The listener understands this is sarcastic criticism, not genuine welcome. They may feel frustrated or defensive about being called out."
    },
    {
      "subtype": "mixed-signals",
      "context": "At a family dinner, a parent asks their adult child about their new job. The child has been struggling but doesn't want to worry their parents.",
      "speaker_role": "adult child",
      "listener_role": "parent",
      "utterance": "It's going fine, really. Everything's fine.",
      "ground_truth_emotion": "fear",
      "explanation": "The repetition of 'fine' and 'really' signals something is wrong. The parent likely feels worried or anxious about what's being hidden."
    },
    {
      "subtype": "mixed-signals",
      "context": "A friend asks another friend if they're okay after noticing they've been quiet all evening. The quiet friend responds while avoiding eye contact.",
      "speaker_role": "quiet friend",
      "listener_role": "concerned friend",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I'm good. Just tired.",
      "ground_truth_emotion": "sadness",
      "explanation": "The body language contradicts the verbal message. The listener senses something is wrong and may feel helpless or sad about their friend's state."
    },
    {
      "subtype": "strategic-politeness",
      "context": "During a project review, a senior manager reviews a junior employee's proposal. The proposal has significant flaws.",
      "speaker_role": "senior manager",
      "listener_role": "junior employee",
      "utterance": "This is certainly a creative approach. Let's discuss some... alternative directions.",
      "ground_truth_emotion": "fear",
      "explanation": "The hedged language ('creative approach', 'alternative directions') signals criticism wrapped in politeness. The listener likely feels anxious about the implied rejection."
    },
    {
      "subtype": "strategic-politeness",
      "context": "A customer service representative has just offered a solution that doesn't actually solve the customer's problem.",
      "speaker_role": "customer",
      "listener_role": "service representative",
      "utterance": "I appreciate your help, but I'm not sure that quite addresses my concern.",
      "ground_truth_emotion": "surprise",
      "explanation": "The polite framing masks criticism. The representative may be caught off guard that their solution was inadequate."
    },
    {
      "subtype": "passive-aggression",
      "context": "One roommate has been leaving dishes in the sink for a week. The other roommate finally says something while aggressively washing them.",
      "speaker_role": "clean roommate",
      "listener_role": "messy roommate",
      "utterance": "Don't worry about it. I'll just do them myself. Like always.",
      "ground_truth_emotion": "anger",
      "explanation": "The 'don't worry about it' is not genuine—it's accusatory. The listener likely feels defensive and angry about the passive-aggressive delivery."
    },
    {
      "subtype": "passive-aggression",
      "context": "A parent asked their teenager to clean their room before guests arrived. The teenager did a minimal job, and the parent inspects the room.",
      "speaker_role": "parent",
      "listener_role": "teenager",
      "utterance": "Well, I suppose that's one way to clean a room.",
      "ground_truth_emotion": "anger",
      "explanation": "The statement implies the room isn't actually clean. The teenager likely feels frustrated by the indirect criticism."
    },
    {
      "subtype": "deflection-misdirection",
      "context": "During a performance review, an employee's manager asks about a missed deadline on an important project.",
      "speaker_role": "employee",
      "listener_role": "manager",
      "utterance": "You know what's been really interesting lately? The new project management tools the other teams are using.",
      "ground_truth_emotion": "anger",
      "explanation": "The obvious topic change avoids accountability. The manager likely feels frustrated by the deflection."
    },
    {
      "subtype": "deflection-misdirection",
      "context": "At a family gathering, a relative asks a young adult when they're planning to get married. The young adult's partner is present.",
      "speaker_role": "young adult",
      "listener_role": "relative",
      "utterance": "Oh look, is that Aunt Martha? I haven't said hello to her yet!",
      "ground_truth_emotion": "surprise",
      "explanation": "The abrupt subject change signals discomfort with the question. The relative may be taken aback by the obvious avoidance."
